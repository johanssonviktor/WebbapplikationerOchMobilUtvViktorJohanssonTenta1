## Travel to Tianjin!

Forever being compared to Běijīng (if anything, it's more like Shànghǎi), 
the former foreign concession port of Tiānjīn (天津) is a large, booming, yet laid-back city, 
with a pleasant river promenade and some charming, European-flavoured neighbourhoods. 
It's an easy day trip from the capital, but you may want a long weekend to explore the city properly.
