# Travel to Prague

Prague offers so much more than alluring architecture, abundant brews and an inherently romantic atmosphere. 
The city has kept up with European trends in the realms of art, fashion, gastronomy and more, 
lending it a contemporary sheen that merges comfortably with its historical and architectural prowess. 
Indeed, as you browse the wealth of impressive Gothic, Baroque and Renaissance buildings (Powder Tower; St. Vitus Cathedral; Kinsky Palace), 
it’s difficult not to be equally bewitched by the trendy boutiques, swish hotels, and chic cocktail bars and microbreweries that pepper most downtown streets these days.

The city’s various epochs – Slavic, Habsburgian, Communist – are also still visible and make for fascinating explorations, as do their associated personalities, 
from Rudolf II to Franz Kafka. When the centre gets too much, hit the neighbourhoods – Vinohrady, Žižkov, Karlín, Holešovice – which throw up all kinds of interesting surprises, 
from independent galleries and cosy jazz bars to the witty public art of David Černý, and plenty of hidden gardens and churches.
