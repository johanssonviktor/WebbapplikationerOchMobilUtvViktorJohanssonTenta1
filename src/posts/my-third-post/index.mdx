# Travel north of the wall!

Whether you're a hardcore adrenaline junkie, a wildlife enthusiast or a city slicker looking for cutting-edge culture, Canada ticks all the boxes.
The world's second largest country(by total area) racks up an astonishing diversity of landscapes; the vast Canadian Praries rise abruptly to the glacier-topped Rocky Mountains; rugged,
unspoiled coastlines give away to immense forests and emerald lakses; and Arctic waters la√• upon frozen tundra. Incredibly, this wilderness is also home to cosmopolitan cities, quirky towns and remote ingenous settlements.
