## Get started

1.  **How to use**

    You need to install all my packages and plugins, which you can do by open the terminal in the root of the porject and run npm install.
    After that you can type gatsby develop in the terminal to launch the page on a local server (localhost:8000) and you can now begin to edit the code for the page.
    You also need to have node installed.

    ```shell
    # Installs all packages and plugins
    npm install
    ```

    ```shell
    # Runs the page on localhost:8000
    gatsby develop
    ```

 ## Dynamical methods

1. **Similarities and usage**

  There a two types to create dynamical pages, one is server-side and the other is client-side. 
  Server side pages is constructed by an application that process server side scripts.
  Client side pages processes the page with html and Javascript, and javascript can be used to update the DOM tree dynamically.

  There is also possible to combine these two methods in a single project for a web application. 
  This can for example be made with React, node and gatsby or with ASP.net Blazor

  This project also used Gatsby which is a framework for react, and offers alot of already made plugins that you can use in your react project.
  With both react and blazor you use components to style your page. And you use componentes to render your page.
  These components can be reused and are easy to use.
  These components can be rendered dynamically. React is a Javascript framework, and javascript is the most used front-end language on the webb. So if i would make a highly interactive webbpage i would choose react, and javascript as tools. On the other hand if i would need to use alot of back-end programming i would choose ASP.Net and blazor which is more usefull for server-side applications, and ASP.net offers more security.
